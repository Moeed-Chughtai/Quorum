The composition should feature a wide-angle perspective showcasing a massive, seamless white quartz island with waterfall edges, perfectly centered under a trio of modern, sculptural brass pendant lights that cast a warm, focused glow. In the background, custom, deep navy blue shaker cabinetry contrasts elegantly with matte black appliance handles and polished chrome fixtures. The flooring is wide-plank, light-oak engineered wood, reflecting the natural light flooding in from large, strategically placed windows dressed with sheer linen curtains. The mood is aspirational, sophisticated, and immaculately clean. The color palette is dominated by crisp whites, deep navy blues, warm brass accents, and natural wood tones. **Negative Prompts:** cartoon, illustration, blurry, low-resolution, messy, cluttered, visible people, outdated appliances, excessive clutter, poor lighting."
